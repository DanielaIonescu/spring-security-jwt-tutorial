This is a tutorial of how to make a simple implementation of a Bearer Authorization (with jwt) using Spring security.
We have an H2 inmemory db for testing purposes linked with the UserRepository -> used for the UserService implementation.
This could be replaced with any other implementation you like.

There are 3 exposed endpoints
1. /public/login
2. /hello/user
3. /hello/admin

1. If correct credentials are used in payload, it will return an authorization header that should be used in order to access the other 2 endpoints.
The authenticated user (with AT) -> should have the needed authorities in order to access on or the other resource (user or admin)
